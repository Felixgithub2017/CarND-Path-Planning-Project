Thanks to the Q&A session, on which my code relies heavily.

### Goals
In this project I need to make the car safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. The car's localization and sensor fusion data are ready for use, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.


### Set the maximum speed of the car
This is done in line 221.

### Check if there is a car in the front, left or right
The simulator provided sensor fusion data, so I can use it to check if there is a car in the front, left or right of the 'main car'.
First, I need to find out the lanes in which 'other cars' are following.(line 294 to 303)
Then, I need to find out if there is a car in the front, left or right of the 'main car'.(line 305 to 331)

### Lane changing and speed control
I have divided this problem to three scenarios, when the 'main car' is in lane 0, lane 1 and lane 2.
I designed the lane changing and speed control logic for all three scenarios.(line 335 to 367)

### Path Generation
This is the core of the project.
In order to execute the above behaviors, I have to determine which path is the best.
The inspiration of my path generation code comes from the project code walk through in the course, which strats with finding any previous points.

Two vectors are defined as ptsx and ptsy to store the path points.

vector<double> ptsx;
vector<double> ptsy;

First, I obtain the main car's (x,y) coordinate and yaw;

double ref_x = car_x;
double ref_y = car_y;
double ref_yaw = deg2rad(car_yaw);

Then, I check if there are any previous points for the previous path.
If not, I use the main car's current point (x,y coordinate) to generate a previous point (x,y coordinate), and then add these two points to vector ptsx and ptsy.

If yes, the main car's current point (x,y coordinate) becomes the previous point, and the original previous point becomes the one before the previous point.
Similarly, add these two points to vector ptsx and ptsy.

if (prev_size < 2)
{
	double prev_car_x = car_x - cos(car_yaw);
    double prev_car_y = car_y - sin(car_yaw);

    ptsx.push_back(prev_car_x);
    ptsx.push_back(car_x);

    ptsy.push_back(prev_car_y);
    ptsy.push_back(car_y);
            
} else{
    ref_x = previous_path_x[prev_size - 1];
    ref_y = previous_path_y[prev_size - 1];

    double ref_x_prev = previous_path_x[prev_size - 2];
    double ref_y_prev = previous_path_y[prev_size - 2];
    ref_yaw = atan2(ref_y-ref_y_prev, ref_x-ref_x_prev);

    ptsx.push_back(ref_x_prev);
    ptsx.push_back(ref_x);

    ptsy.push_back(ref_y_prev);
    ptsy.push_back(ref_y);
	}

Next, I need to set three future points and add them to vector ptsx and ptsy.
These points are 30 meters apart, more points will be filled in afterwards.

vector<double> next_wp0 = getXY(car_s + 30, 2 + 4*lane, map_waypoints_s, map_waypoints_x, map_waypoints_y);
vector<double> next_wp1 = getXY(car_s + 60, 2 + 4*lane, map_waypoints_s, map_waypoints_x, map_waypoints_y);
vector<double> next_wp2 = getXY(car_s + 90, 2 + 4*lane, map_waypoints_s, map_waypoints_x, map_waypoints_y);

ptsx.push_back(next_wp0[0]);
ptsx.push_back(next_wp1[0]);
ptsx.push_back(next_wp2[0]);

ptsy.push_back(next_wp0[1]);
ptsy.push_back(next_wp1[1]);
ptsy.push_back(next_wp2[1]);

Next, coordinates in vector ptsx and ptsy need to be transformed to local car coordinates. Use a for loop to transform all the points in vector ptsx and ptsy.

for (int i = 0; i < ptsx.size(); i++)
{
    double shift_x = ptsx[i] - ref_x;
    double shift_y = ptsy[i] - ref_y;

    ptsx[i] = shift_x * cos(0 - ref_yaw) - shift_y * sin(0 - ref_yaw);
    ptsy[i] = shift_x * sin(0 - ref_yaw) + shift_y * cos(0 - ref_yaw);
}

It's time to introduce a powerful tool: spline, which can be downloaded from https://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/
It is a single header file, and it is very easy to use.
As I have a set of x coordinates(ptsx) and a set of y coordinates(ptsy), I am able to use spline to fit a curve(a function that returns y for each x on the curve) that runs through all the points.

tk::spline s;
s.set_points(ptsx, ptsy);

Finally, I calculate the (x,y) coordinates for all the points of the path, and then transform them back to global coordinates, and finally add them to vector next_x_vals and next_y_vals.

double target_x = 30.0;
double target_y = s(target_x);
double target_dist = sqrt(target_x*target_x + target_y*target_y);

double x_add_on = 0;

for(int i = 1; i < 50 - prev_size; i++)
{
    double N = target_dist/(0.02*ref_vel/2.24);
    double x_point = x_add_on + target_x/N;
    double y_point = s(x_point);

    x_add_on = x_point;

    double x_ref = x_point;
    double y_ref = y_point;

    x_point = x_ref * cos(ref_yaw) - y_ref * sin(ref_yaw);
    y_point = x_ref * sin(ref_yaw) + y_ref * cos(ref_yaw);

    x_point += ref_x;
    y_point += ref_y;

    next_x_vals.push_back(x_point);
    next_y_vals.push_back(y_point);

}

Finally, next_x_vals and next_y_vals can be transmitted to the simulator.

# The following is original Udacity README

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
